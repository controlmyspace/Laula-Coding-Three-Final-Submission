                        These pages hold the moments that shaped us. Every photograph tells a story. That's why a family photo album is so precious, especially now as the art of creating a physical album has slowly died with the digitization of memories. For me these shared moments are the most precious, as it is a practise of sharing stories, memories and emotions. I hope to continue to curate photo albums. As I believe this is a necessary practise of intentionality and taking ownership of our family histories and cultural heritage.

                        Inpired by projects such as the Palestinian Museum of Digital Archives, I was motivated to further archive and explore my family and cultural history. This is especially important for people who carry the weight of a decolonial past where our cultures have been attempted to be erased. In Kazakhstan, this happened under Russian Imperialism,, which carried onto Soviet Imperialism. Forced collectivization was an act of genocide causing famine in the 1930s, as well as the persecution of many kazakh people. Leading to not only our population decreasing to the minority, but also to many kazakhs fleeing. <br><br>
                        This is a picture of my grandfather and his colleagues. He is the only person in my close family who speaks kazakh fluently and it is his predominant language. Unfortnately, I only speak Russian and my younger sibling only English. This is why preserving our culture beyond just language is important. A photo album is a tool that consolidates our identities and shares our history with future generations.

                        Now memories and albums mostly live on our phones. The nature of how we store, create and share our memories are now on social media and messaging platforms. Although this isn't a bad thing, there is something much less appealing because from my experiences although we are more immediately connected to each other. We are enabled to be connected in isolation. <br><br>
                        Recently, I have begun taking pictures on a film camera, there is a general trend for people returning to digital cameras from the 2000s and film cameras. I think most of us miss the slowness of the past. Delayed satisfaction and reward. Also the phone takes such horrible photos in comparison. I hope this isn't just a trend but we all slow down and cherish momemnts, memories and photographs more. Rather than take it for granted.

                    <p class="page-body">
                        I recently found out that my paternal grandpa had a step mother that was an ever present figure in his life, my grandma's (his wife) and my dad's. <br><br>
                        It was a strange revelation because no one had ever mentioned her significant role in our family before. It was as if she had dissapeared. I don't remember seeing any photos of her or hearing her name. For me this is why a photo album is important. Because it let's us not only revisit our past, but remember and honour those who came before us. I believe our anestral ties are deep and spiritual. <br><br>
                        A photo tells one story, but a photo album creates a narrative, ties people, stories and places together. Creates a whole. That's why to me a photo album is precious, because in comparison a photo feels like a missing piece. It can be manipulated, truths omitted. Whilst a photo album can capture the mood of an event, the culture, the fashion, the climate of the time.
